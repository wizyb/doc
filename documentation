Infrastructure documentation
First box label aws is my amazon virtual machine or server that house my instructure and resources.
Next is my VPC ip: 10.0.0.0/16 which is my virtual private cloud which contains my subnet. The subnet is both front end and backend. The front end subnet controls traffic in n out of the vpc while the backend subnet only communicate with the front end subnet.

Next is cidr blocks which helps to allocate ips addresses to my subnets. The frontend subnet ip address is 10.0.0.0/24 while the back is allocated 10.1.0.0.0/24
